I am building a production-ready website for a real bank in Ghana named Gold Coast Central Bank (GCC Bank).

I need you to generate a highly professional, responsive, and secure homepage, plus login and registration pages, using PHP, HTML, CSS, and optionally Bootstrap. This is not a dashboard — this is the main public website of the bank.

🧱 Purpose:
This homepage is the official online face of Gold Coast Central Bank, a respected and growing financial institution in Ghana. It must be credible, sleek, modern, and aligned with the wealth and legacy of Ghana, especially its historical connection to gold.

🎯 Requirements:
The design must match the bank's logo, using consistent colors (e.g. deep gold, black, white/light grey backgrounds) with professional typography.

Reflect trust, security, heritage, and growth.

The code must be clean, modular, and ready for production.

Pages should follow W3C standards, use semantic HTML, and ensure cross-browser compatibility.

Code should avoid unnecessary complexity. Keep it scalable and developer-friendly.

🌍 Sections to include on Homepage (index.php):
Header/Navbar – With bank logo, navigation links (Home, Services, About Us, Contact, Login/Register).

Hero Section – Full-width banner with bold tagline like “Empowering Ghana’s Financial Future” with CTA buttons (“Open an Account”, “Learn More”).

About Us – Short section on the bank’s mission, values, and origin of the name (inspired by Ghana’s Gold Coast legacy).

Our Services – Cards or sections for:

Personal Banking

Business Banking

International Transfers

Mobile Money Integration

Digital Wallet

Security and Compliance – Showcase bank’s security features (SSL, KYC, encryption, fraud protection).

Why Choose Us – Highlight what makes GCC Bank different (customer service, speed, integration, mobile-first).

Client Testimonials – 2-3 short quotes from customers (dummy content for now).

Footer – Include contact info, branch locations (placeholder), quick links, and social media icons.

🔐 Auth Pages:
login.php – Clean, secure login page (username/email + password). Include basic PHP validation.

register.php – Registration form with name, email, phone, password (confirm), and optional referral code.

Add form validation (client-side + server-side placeholders).

🔧 Technical Requirements:
Use vanilla PHP, HTML, CSS, and optionally Bootstrap (no frontend JS frameworks).

JavaScript allowed only for light enhancements (form validation, modals, toggles).

CSS should be scoped or modular — NO global conflicts with other parts of the platform (e.g. dashboard).

Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Make it lightweight, fast, and SEO-ready.

Placeholders for dynamic content (e.g. <?= $user['name'] ?>) are okay.

🧠 Optional Enhancements:
Add a confirmation popup after successful registration/login (with overlay).

Use smooth scrolling and basic animations to give a premium UX.

🎯 Focus on making it look and feel like a REAL BANK in operation — not a startup, not a "cool fintech" — this is a solid, secure, powerful Ghanaian bank ready to serve local and global customers.
